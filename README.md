This is my first project, during my education in frontend development/software engineering. 🚀

In this project, we've got to build a E-commerce website, using only HTML and CSS. Containg a homepage, product-detail page. And also an administration page. 🖥️

The two first pages is pretty straight forward, a homepage containing a header, hero image, three spots (only shown in 1024px), following 8 sample products. And lastly a footer, one accordion to be used only in 640px. But a static one used for bigger screens 💻.

Product-details, is a overview of the product, followed by 3 ''similar'' products.

The first administration page is just a table containg product-name,  SKU, and price. The second admin-page is a form to be filled by the user to add another product, since the page is static, nothing happens when the user presses ''lägg till'' (submit in 🇸🇪).
